# 执行规则
1. 重量选择：RPE7（较吃力，剩余3次力竭），硬拉、深蹲等复合动作宁轻勿重，优先保证动作标准
2. 动作节奏：复合动作（深蹲、硬拉、卧推）离心3秒，向心1秒；孤立动作（侧平举、弯举）离心2秒，向心1秒
3. 安全提示：
   - 硬拉时避免弓背（易导致腰椎损伤），若无法保持背部挺直，立即减轻重量
   - 哑铃卧推时需有人保护（避免哑铃掉落砸伤），或使用固定器械替代
   - 训练中若出现关节疼痛（如膝盖、腰部刺痛），立即停止该动作，改为其他替代动作

# 6周进阶计划
- 第1-2周：按上述计划执行，熟悉动作模式
- 第3-4周：重量增加10-15%，RPE提升至7.5（剩余2-3次力竭）
- 第5-6周：部分动作增加组数（如深蹲从3×10改为4×10），或增加次数（如硬拉从3×8改为3×10）

# 三、新手训练核心原则
# 1. 动作标准优先于重量和次数
- 专业依据：新手期神经肌肉控制能力弱，动作不标准会导致肌肉代偿（如深蹲时膝盖内扣，会增加半月板压力），增加受伤风险（来源：NASM新手训练指南）
- 建议：前2周不追求重量，用轻重量/徒手练习，对着镜子纠正动作，或找专业教练指导

# 2. 渐进超负荷原则（缓慢提升强度）
- 核心逻辑：训练效果的产生依赖“渐进式增加训练负荷”，但新手需缓慢提升（每周负荷增加不超过10%）
- 提升方式：优先增加次数（如从10次增加到12次），再增加重量（如从5kg增加到6kg），最后增加组数（如从3组增加到4组）

# 3. 避免过度训练
- 新手每周训练次数不超过3次，每次训练时长不超过60分钟（神经和肌肉恢复能力有限）
- 训练后若出现肌肉酸痛超过72小时，或关节疼痛，立即减少训练量50%

# 四、常见问题解答
# 1. 新手是否需要孤立训练（如二头肌弯举、三头肌下压）？
- 建议：前3个月以复合动作为主（深蹲、卧推、划船、硬拉），复合动作可同时激活多个肌群，提升训练效率，建立基础力量；3个月后可适当加入孤立动作（每周1-2次）

# 2. 训练后肌肉酸痛是否代表训练有效？
- 专业解答：肌肉酸痛（DOMS）是肌肉微损伤的表现，与训练效果有一定关联，但不是唯一标准。新手期酸痛明显是正常的，随着身体适应，酸痛会逐渐减轻，此时需通过增加负荷来维持训练效果

# 3. 新手是否需要使用补剂？
- 建议：优先通过饮食获取营养（蛋白质、碳水、脂肪），无需额外补剂；若饮食中蛋白质摄入不足，可适量使用乳清蛋白补剂（每日不超过20g）

# 专业提示
1. 训练日志：每次训练记录动作、重量、组数、次数，方便后续进阶调整
2. 休息时间：组间休息不可过短（复合动作需90-150秒），休息时可补充少量水分（每次50-100ml）
3. 就医提示：训练中若出现急性疼痛（如腰部刺痛、膝盖剧痛），立即停止训练，必要时就医检查

# Gym Beginner Training Splits
Purpose: For beginners with less than 6 months of training experience, it is designed based on the "NASM OPT Model (Performance Optimization Training Model)", prioritizing the establishment of basic movement patterns, enhancing neuromuscular control, avoiding excessive segmentation and high-intensity training, and reducing the risk of injury.

# Prerequisites (Must be met before starting training)
1. Has passed the basic health screening (PAR-Q questionnaire), and has no red flag symptoms (such as history of heart disease, history of joint replacement, acute pain)
2. Master core movement patterns: squats, pushes, pulls, and core stability (can be mastered proficiently through bare-handed practice)
3. Training equipment: Basic equipment (dumbbells, barbells, fixed equipment). Beginners are advised to start with fixed equipment (which offers higher stability).
4. Warm-up and Relaxation: Before each training session, follow warmup_cooldown.md (warmup for 10 minutes and relax for 10 minutes).

# II. Recommended Splitting Plan (Sorted by Priority)
# Plan A: Full-body training twice a week (suitable for those with tight schedules or weak recovery abilities)
# Applicable Population
The disposable training time per week is less than 1.5 hours
- Age over 40 / First exposure to strength training/Weak recovery ability
- Slight discomfort in the joints (such as mild knee arthritis)

# Training Plan (45-60 minutes each time, with an interval of ≥72 hours, such as Monday + Thursday)
Training Day: Exercise Name: Number of Sets × Repetitions: RPE: Break Between Sets: Key Points of Technique (Core!) ) |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|-----|----------|-------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------|
Day1: Fixed Equipment Squats: 3×12, 6, 90 seconds: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, slightly extend your toes by 15 degrees, follow the direction of your knees, squat down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, and tighten your core without sagging your back
Seated machine chest Press: 3×12, 6, 90 seconds. Keep your back close to the seat, tighten your shoulder blades, hold the machine handles at shoulder height with both hands, and push until your arms are slightly bent (without locking your elbows), then slowly return
Auxiliary pull-ups (resistance band) 3×10 6 seconds 90 seconds One end of the resistance band is fixed on the horizontal bar, both feet step on the resistance band, pull until the chest is close to the horizontal bar, and control the lowering slowly without swinging
Plank: 3×40 seconds, 6 × 60 seconds, four-point support, elbows directly below the shoulders, body in a straight line, core tightened, no sagging waist or lifted buttocks
Standing dumbbell lateral lift: 2×15, 5, 60 seconds. Hold a light dumbbell (1-2kg) with both hands, let your arms hang naturally, and lift it to shoulder height. Avoid shrugging your shoulders and lower it slowly
Day2: Bulgarian split Squat: 3×10/ leg: 6:90 seconds: Place the back leg on the chair, take a step forward with the front leg, squat down until the front thigh is parallel to the ground, tighten the core, and avoid the front knee going beyond the toes
Seated equipment shoulder press: 3×12, 6, 90 seconds. Keep your back close to the seat, hold the equipment handles at shoulder height with both hands, and push until your arms are slightly bent. When replaying, control slowly without shrugging your shoulders
Bend dumbbell row: 3×12, 6, 90 seconds. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, slightly bend your knees, lean your upper body forward at a 45-degree Angle, keep your back straight, hold the dumbbells with both hands, pull them to your waist, and tighten your shoulder blades
Reverse crunches: 3×15, 6, 60 seconds. Lie on your back, bend your legs, place your feet on the ground, and tighten your abdomen. Lift your hips off the ground and lower them slowly, avoiding using your waist to exert force
Standing dumbbell curl: 2×15, 5, 60 seconds. Hold the dumbbells with both hands, let your arms hang naturally, keep your elbows close to your body, curl until the dumbbells are close to your shoulders, and slowly return them to avoid body swaying

# Execution Rules
1. Weight selection: RPE6 (able to easily complete the target number of repetitions, with 4 remaining exhausted repetitions). Beginners should prefer light weights over heavy ones, prioritizing the standard movement
2. Movement rhythm: Eccentric (lowering) for 3 seconds, concentric (pushing/pulling) for 1 second. For example, when doing squats, slowly squat down for 3 seconds and quickly stand up for 1 second
3. Common Error Correction
- Squat and waist sag: Tighten your core and imagine "your navel touching your spine". You can start by practicing bodyweight squats to get the feel
- Chest push and shoulder shrug: Tighten the shoulder blades in advance. When pushing, keep the shoulder blades stable and do not shrug the shoulders
- Rowing with a hunched back: Keep your upper body at a 45° Angle and your back straight. You can practice in front of a mirror

# 4-Week Advanced Plan
Weeks 1-2: Follow the above plan and get familiar with the movement patterns
Weeks 3-4: Increase weight by 10-15%, raise RPE to 7 (with 3 remaining exhaustion), and extend plank to 50 seconds per set

# Plan B: Full-body training three times a week (suitable for those with sufficient time and good adaptability)
Applicable population
The disposable training time per week is 1.5 to 3 hours
- Age: 18-40 years old/No joint discomfort/Daily light activities (such as walking, cycling)
- Training objective: Enhance basic strength and muscle mass

Reverse crunches: 3×15, 6, 60 seconds. Lie on your back, bend your legs, place your feet on the ground, tighten your abdomen forcefully, and lift your hips off the ground. Slow down release

# Execution Rules
1. Weight selection: RPE7 (more strenuous, with 3 remaining exhaustion attempts). For compound movements such as deadlifts and squats, it is better to do light rather than heavy, and prioritize ensuring the standard of the movements
2. Movement rhythm: For compound movements (squats, deadlifts, bench presses), perform eccentric movements for 3 seconds and concentric movements for 1 second. For isolated movements (lateral horizontal lift, curved lift), perform eccentric movements for 2 seconds and concentric movements for 1 second
3. Safety Tips
When doing deadlifts, avoid arching your back (as it can easily cause lumbar spine injuries). If you can't keep your back straight, immediately reduce the weight
When doing dumbbell bench presses, someone should protect you (to prevent the dumbbells from falling and injuring you), or use fixed equipment as an alternative
If joint pain (such as stabbing pain in the knees or waist) occurs during training, stop the movement immediately and switch to another alternative movement

# 6-Week Advanced Plan
Weeks 1-2: Follow the above plan and get familiar with the movement patterns
Weeks 3-4: Weight gain of 10-15%, RPE raised to 7.5 (with 2-3 exhaustion remaining)
Weeks 5-6: Increase the number of sets for some exercises (such as changing squats from 3×10 to 4×10), or increase the number of repetitions (such as changing deadlifts from 3×8 to 3×10).

# III. Core Principles of Beginner Training
# 1. The standard of movement takes precedence over weight and repetitions
Professional basis: During the novice period, the neuromuscular control ability is weak. Non-standard movements can lead to muscle compensation (for example, when doing squats, the knees turning inward will increase the pressure on the meniscus), increasing the risk of injury. (Source: NASM Beginner Training Guide)
Suggestion: For the first two weeks, do not pursue weight. Practice with light weights or bodyweight exercises, correct your movements in front of a mirror, or seek guidance from a professional coach

# 2. Progressive Overload Principle (Gradually increase intensity)
The core logic: The generation of training effects relies on "gradually increasing the training load", but beginners need to increase it slowly (the weekly load increase should not exceed 10%).
- Enhancement method: First increase the number of repetitions (such as from 10 to 12), then increase the weight (such as from 5kg to 6kg), and finally increase the number of sets (such as from 3 sets to 4 sets).

# 3. Avoid overtraining
Novices should train no more than three times a week, and each training session should last no more than 60 minutes (the recovery capacity of nerves and muscles is limited).
If muscle soreness persists for more than 72 hours or joint pain occurs after training, immediately reduce the training volume by 50%

# IV. Frequently Asked Questions
# 1. Do beginners need isolated training (such as biceps curls, triceps pulps)?
Suggestion: In the first three months, focus mainly on compound movements (squats, bench presses, rows, deadlifts). Compound movements can simultaneously activate multiple muscle groups, enhance training efficiency, and build basic strength. After three months, isolated movements can be appropriately added (1-2 times a week).

# 2. Does muscle soreness after training indicate that the training is effective?
- Professional answer: DOMS is a manifestation of minor muscle damage and is related to the training effect to some extent, but it is not the only criterion. It is normal for beginners to experience obvious soreness during the training period. As the body ADAPTS, the soreness will gradually ease. At this point, it is necessary to maintain the training effect by increasing the load

# 3. Do beginners need to use supplements?
Suggestion: Prioritize obtaining nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) through diet, without the need for additional supplements. If the protein intake in the diet is insufficient, whey protein supplements can be used in moderation (no more than 20g per day).
