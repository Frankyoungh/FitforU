# 每周训练框架 | weekly volume basics

目的：给新手和进阶用户一个「一周练多少算合理」的范围，用于生成与校验训练计划。

## 适用人群
- 年满 16 岁，已完成基础健康问询（无明显红旗症状）
- 目标为：减脂、增肌、提升体能、养成运动习惯的健康人群

## 不适用人群（参考 red_flags.md / sick_day_rule.md）
- 存在胸痛、胸闷、心悸、晕厥、无法解释的呼吸困难
- 明显高血压未控制、近期手术、大伤病恢复早期
- 妊娠高风险人群或医生明确限制活动者

## 有氧运动建议

**新手（0–3 个月）**

- 每周总时长：150–300 分钟「轻到中等强度」为目标区间
- 单次：20–40 分钟
- 每周：3–5 天
- RPE：3–6（能说话，略喘）

**进阶（>3 个月且适应良好）**

- 可逐步加入：
  - 1–2 次中高强度间歇（RPE 7–8）
  - 总时长根据恢复情况增加到 200–400 分钟

## 力量训练建议

**新手：**

- 每周 2–3 次全身力量或上/下肢分化
- 每个大肌群：
  - 每周 6–10 工作组
  - RPE 6–8（保留 2–4 次力竭余量）
- 相同肌群训练间隔 ≥ 48 小时

**进阶：**

- 每个大肌群每周 10–20 工作组
- 根据恢复情况调整；如连续 1–2 周出现明显疲劳或关节疼痛，应先减量 30–50%。

## 进阶与减量原则

- 单周总量提升不超过上周的 5–10%。
- 连续 6–8 周训练后，建议 1 周「减量周」：总量降 30–50%，保留动作节奏。
- 如出现 DOMS 超过 72 小时、关节痛、睡眠明显变差，优先减量或休息（详见 doms_vs_injury.md）。

# weekly volume basics

Objective: To provide both novice and advanced users with a range of "how much is reasonable to practice in a week" for generating and verifying training plans.

Applicable population
- At least 16 years old, having completed basic health inquiries (without obvious red flag symptoms)
The goal is for healthy individuals who aim to lose fat, build muscle, enhance physical fitness, and develop a habit of exercising

Not applicable to (refer to red_flags.md/sick_day_rule-.md)
There are symptoms such as chest pain, chest tightness, palpitations, syncope and unexplained breathing difficulties
- Obvious uncontrolled hypertension, recent surgery, early recovery from major injuries
People at high risk of pregnancy or those whose activities are explicitly restricted by doctors

Aerobic exercise suggestions

"Novice (0-3 months).

- Total weekly duration: 150 to 300 minutes, with the target range being "light to moderate intensity"
- Single session: 20-40 minutes
- Week: 3 to 5 days
-RPE: 3-6 (Can speak, slightly breathless)

"Advanced (more than 3 months and good adaptation)

- Can be gradually added:
1-2 medium to high-intensity intervals (RPE 7-8)
The total duration will increase to 200-400 minutes depending on the recovery situation

Strength training suggestions

** Novice: **

- Perform general strength or upper/lower limb differentiation 2 to 3 times a week
- Each major muscle group:
- Weekly 6-10 working group
-RPE 6-8 (retain 2-4 times of exhaustion remaining)
The training interval for the same muscle group should be no less than 48 hours

"Advanced:

Each major muscle group works 10 to 20 groups per week
- Adjust according to the recovery situation; If obvious fatigue or joint pain occurs for 1 to 2 consecutive weeks, the dosage should be reduced by 30 to 50% first.

The principle of advancement and reduction

The total increase in a single week shall not exceed 5% to 10% of that of the previous week.
After 6 to 8 consecutive weeks of training, it is recommended to have a "reduction week" for one week: reduce the total volume by 30 to 50% while retaining the movement rhythm.
If DOMS exceeds 72 hours, joint pain occurs, or sleep quality significantly deteriorates, priority should be given to reducing the intake or taking rest (for details, see doms_vs_injury.md).
