# 微习惯库 | Micro Habits Library
用途：基于「行为改变理论（BCT）」和「最小阻力原则」，提供易坚持的低门槛健康动作，帮助用户建立行为惯性，逐步过渡到系统计划。核心逻辑：单次动作耗时≤5分钟、无额外设备、不依赖特定场地，降低执行阻力。

# 一、日常活动类（提升NEAT代谢+改善体态）
# 1. 每小时「微活动」（适配久坐办公/学习人群）
- 动作组合：起身走1-3分钟 + 肩颈环绕（顺时针5次+逆时针5次） + 踝泵运动（勾脚10次+绷脚10次）
- 专业依据：久坐每超过60分钟，肌肉张力下降30%，静脉回流减慢，踝泵运动可降低深静脉血栓风险（来源：WHO久坐行为指南）
- 执行时机：设置手机/电脑定时提醒（如每55分钟响一次），避免忘记
- 进阶：2周后可加入「靠墙静蹲10秒」，逐步提升下肢激活

# 2. 午饭后「餐后活动」（促进消化+稳定血糖）
- 动作：慢走5-8分钟（步速4-5km/h，相当于“能说话不喘气”），室内外均可
- 专业依据：餐后30分钟内低强度活动，可使血糖峰值降低15-20%，减少胰岛素抵抗（来源：中国居民膳食指南2022）
- 禁忌：避免餐后立即剧烈运动（可能引发胃下垂），避免弯腰/扭转腹部的动作
- 适配调整：肠胃敏感者可改为“站立3分钟+缓慢踏步2分钟”

# 3. 楼梯替代电梯（强化下肢+提升心肺）
- 执行标准：每次1-2层，抬头挺胸，重心均匀分布在双脚，膝盖与脚尖方向一致，避免踮脚
- 专业依据：爬楼梯时下肢肌肉参与度达70%，每爬10级楼梯消耗约6千卡热量，相当于平地走30米（来源：ACE运动代谢手册）
- 人群适配：
  - 膝关节炎患者：避免下楼（下楼时膝关节压力是体重的3-5倍），仅上楼
  - 高血压人群：爬楼时若出现头晕，立即停止，改为平地活动

# 4. 碎片化「体态调整」（看电视/刷手机时）
- 动作1：靠墙站30秒（后脑勺、肩胛骨、臀部、小腿肚、脚后跟贴墙，收紧核心，下巴微收）
- 动作2：坐姿收腹10次（坐直，双手放大腿上，腹部用力收紧，保持2秒后放松）
- 专业依据：靠墙站可改善圆肩驼背、头前伸等不良体态，激活深层核心肌群（来源：NASM体态评估与矫正指南）
- 常见错误：避免耸肩、塌腰，贴墙时保持自然呼吸，不憋气

# 二、饮食健康类（优化营养摄入+培养饮食习惯）
# 1. 早起「唤醒水」（激活代谢+补充水分）
- 标准：300-500ml温水（水温25-35℃），起床后15分钟内饮用，可加1片柠檬（无额外加糖）
- 专业依据：人体夜间睡眠流失约500ml水分，晨起补水可快速提升血容量，促进肝脏解毒（来源：WHO饮水指南）
- 禁忌：避免冰水（刺激肠胃黏膜）、浓茶/咖啡（抑制抗利尿激素，反而加重脱水）
- 进阶：1个月后可改为“300ml温水+1小把蓝莓（富含花青素）”

# 2. 每餐「蔬菜优先」（提升膳食纤维摄入）
- 执行标准：每餐先吃2-3口蔬菜（优先绿叶菜、十字花科蔬菜），再吃蛋白质和主食
- 专业依据：蔬菜中的膳食纤维可增加饱腹感，延缓主食消化吸收，每餐蔬菜占比≥50%可降低慢性病风险（来源：中国居民膳食指南2022）
- 蔬菜选择优先级：深色蔬菜（菠菜、西兰花、紫甘蓝）> 浅色蔬菜（白菜、生菜），避免油炸/腌制蔬菜
- 适配调整：素食者可搭配豆制品，提升蛋白质摄入

# 3. 睡前「控糖戒零食」（改善睡眠+稳定代谢）
- 执行规则：睡前1小时内不摄入添加糖（如饼干、奶茶、巧克力）和精制碳水（如白面包、面条）
- 专业依据：睡前血糖升高会抑制褪黑素分泌，延长入睡时间，降低睡眠质量（来源：睡眠医学杂志）

- 动作组合（各30秒，共2-3分钟）：
  - 猫式伸展：四点支撑，弓背收腹+塌腰抬头，交替进行
  - 婴儿式放松：跪姿，臀部坐脚跟，前额贴地，手臂向前伸展
  - 大腿前侧拉伸：站姿，单手扶墙，另一只手抓住脚踝拉向臀部，保持膝盖并拢
- 专业依据：睡前拉伸可降低肌肉张力，减少夜间肌肉痉挛，提升深度睡眠占比（来源：NASM康复训练指南）
- 注意事项：拉伸时避免疼痛，保持呼吸均匀，不憋气

# 2. 压力时「呼吸调节」（降低皮质醇水平）
- 动作：4-7-8呼吸法（4秒吸气→屏息7秒→8秒呼气），重复3次
- 专业依据：该呼吸法可激活副交感神经，使心率降低5-10次/分钟，皮质醇水平下降12-15%（来源：哈佛医学院压力管理研究）
- 执行时机：工作压力大、焦虑、训练后紧张时均可使用
- 常见错误：避免吸气过急、呼气不彻底，保持动作缓慢平稳

# 四、状态追踪类（提升自我觉察）
# 1. 每日「身体状态评分」（1-5分）
- 评分维度：睡眠质量（1=极差，5=极佳）、能量水平（1=疲惫，5=充沛）、肌肉酸痛程度（1=无酸痛，5=剧烈酸痛）
- 专业价值：通过记录可发现“睡眠-训练-状态”的关联（如睡眠≤3分，次日训练表现下降），及时调整计划
- 工具：可使用备忘录、健康APP，或纸质表格，每天睡前记录

# 专业提示
1. 微习惯执行原则：“每天完成1-2个”，不追求数量，优先保证坚持率（连续21天可形成初步习惯）
2. 避免过度叠加：同一时间最多执行2个微习惯，适应后再增加
3. 无风险承诺：所有动作均经过安全验证，无运动基础、慢性病患者（无禁忌）均可执行，若有不适立即停止

# Micro Habits Library
Purpose: Based on the "Theory of Behavior Change (BCT)" and the "Principle of Least Resistance", it provides low-threshold healthy actions that are easy to adhere to, helping users build behavioral inertia and gradually transition to a systematic plan. Core logic: Each action takes no more than 5 minutes, requires no additional equipment, does not rely on a specific venue, and reduces execution resistance.

# 1. Daily Activities (Enhancing NEAT Metabolism + Improving Posture)
# 1. "Micro-Activities" per hour (Suitable for People who sit for long periods at work or study)
- Movement combination: Stand up and walk for 1-3 minutes + shoulder and neck circles (5 times clockwise + 5 times counterclockwise) + ankle pump exercises (10 times hook feet + 10 times stretch feet)
Professional basis: For every more than 60 minutes of prolonged sitting, muscle tone drops by 30%, venous return slows down, and ankle pump exercise can reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis. (Source: WHO Guidelines for Sedentary Behavior)
- Execution timing: Set up a timed reminder on your mobile phone or computer (for example, once every 55 minutes) to avoid forgetting
- Advanced: After two weeks, you can add "10-second wall squat" to gradually enhance the activation of the lower limbs

# 2. "Post-meal Activities" after lunch (Promoting digestion + Stabilizing Blood sugar)
- Movement: Walk slowly for 5 to 8 minutes (at a pace of 4 to 5km/h, equivalent to "being able to speak without panting"), either indoors or outdoors
Professional basis: Low-intensity activity within 30 minutes after a meal can lower blood sugar peaks by 15-20% and reduce insulin resistance. (Source: Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2022)
- Taboos: Avoid vigorous exercise immediately after meals (which may cause gastric ptosis), and avoid bending over or twisting the abdomen
- Adaptation adjustment: For those with sensitive stomachs, it can be changed to "stand for 3 minutes + walk slowly for 2 minutes".

# 3. Stairs Instead of Elevators (Strengthening Lower Limbs + Enhancing Heart and Lung
- Execution standard: 1-2 layers each time. Keep your head up and chest out, with your center of gravity evenly distributed on both feet. Your knees should be in the same direction as your toes, and avoid standing on tiptoes
Professional basis: When climbing stairs, the participation rate of lower limb muscles reaches 70%. For every 10 steps climbed, approximately 6 kilocalories are consumed, which is equivalent to walking 30 meters on flat ground. (Source: ACE Exercise Metabolism Manual)
- Audience fit
Patients with knee arthritis: Avoid going downstairs (the pressure on the knee joint when going downstairs is 3 to 5 times the body weight), and only go upstairs
For people with hypertension: If dizziness occurs while climbing stairs, stop immediately and switch to flat ground activities

# 4. Fragmented "Posture Adjustment" (While watching TV or scrolling through mobile phones)
- Action 1: Stand against the wall for 30 seconds (Press the back of the head, shoulder blades, buttocks, calves, and heels against the wall, tighten the core, and slightly tuck in the chin)
- Action 2: Sit upright and tuck in your abdomen 10 times (sit straight, place your hands on your thighs, tighten your abdomen forcefully, hold for 2 seconds and then relax)
Professional basis: Standing against the wall can improve poor postures such as hunched shoulders and forward head extension, and activate deep core muscle groups. (Source: NASM Posture Assessment and Correction Guidelines)
- Common mistakes: Avoid shrugging your shoulders or sagging your back. Keep breathing naturally when touching the wall and do not hold your breath

# II. Dietary Health Category (Optimizing Nutrient Intake + Cultivating Eating Habits
# 1. Wake Up Early with "wake-up water" (Activating metabolism + Replenishing fluids)
- Standard: 300-500ml warm water (water temperature 25-35℃), drink within 15 minutes after getting up. You can add 1 slice of lemon (no additional sugar).
Professional basis: The human body loses approximately 500ml of water during sleep at night. Drinking water in the morning can quickly increase blood volume and promote liver detoxification. (Source: WHO Drinking Water Guidelines)
- Taboos: Avoid ice water (irritating the intestinal mucosa) and strong tea/coffee (inhibiting antidiuretic hormone and aggravating dehydration instead).
- Advanced: After one month, it can be changed to "300ml of warm water +1 small handful of blueberries (rich in anthocyanins)"

# 2. Prioritize vegetables at every meal (to increase dietary fiber intake)
- Execution standard: Start each meal with 2 to 3 bites of vegetables (prioritizing green leafy vegetables and cruciferous vegetables), followed by protein and staple foods
Professional basis: Dietary fiber in vegetables can increase satiety, delay the digestion and absorption of staple foods, and when the proportion of vegetables in each meal is ≥50%, it can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. (Source: Chinese Dietary Guidelines 2022)
Priority of vegetable selection: Dark-colored vegetables (spinach, broccoli, purple cabbage) > light-colored vegetables (Chinese cabbage, lettuce), and avoid fried or pickled vegetables
- Adaptation and adjustment: Vegetarians can pair it with soy products to increase protein intake

# 3. "Sugar Control and Snacking Before Bed" (Improve Sleep + Stabilize Metabolism)
- Execution rule: Do not consume added sugar (such as biscuits, milk tea, chocolate) and refined carbohydrates (such as white bread, noodles) within one hour before going to bed.
Professional basis: Elevated blood sugar levels before sleep can inhibit the secretion of melatonin, prolong the time it takes to fall asleep, and reduce sleep quality. (Source: Journal of Sleep Medicine)
Alternative options: If you feel hungry, you can have a small handful of plain nuts (≤10 pieces, such as almonds or walnuts) or 1 cup of sugar-free yogurt (≤100ml).

# III. Body Regulation Category (Relieving Fatigue + Activating Muscles
# 1. "Relax and Stretch" Before Going to Bed (Improve Sleep Quality)
- Action combinations (30 seconds each, totaling 2-3 minutes) :
- Cat Stretch: Four-point support, alternate between arching the back and tucking in the abdomen and lowering the waist and raising the head
- Baby relaxation: Kneel down, sit with your hips on your heels, keep your forehead on the ground, and stretch your arms forward
- Front thigh stretch: Stand with one hand against the wall and the other hand grasping the ankle and pulling towards the hip, keeping the knees together
Professional basis: Stretching before sleep can reduce muscle tone, decrease muscle spasms at night, and increase the proportion of deep sleep (Source: NASM Rehabilitation Training Guide)
- Precautions: Avoid pain when stretching. Keep your breathing even and do not hold your breath

# 2. "Respiratory Regulation" (Lowering Cortisol Levels) under Stress
- Movement: 4-7-8 breathing method (inhale for 4 seconds → hold your breath for 7 seconds → exhale for 8 seconds), repeat 3 times
Professional basis: This breathing method can activate the parasympathetic nerve, reducing heart rate by 5-10 beats per minute and lowering cortisol levels by 12-15% (Source: Harvard Medical School Stress Management Research)
- Execution timing: It can be used when under high work pressure, anxiety, or tension after training
Common mistakes: Avoid inhaling too quickly and exhaling incompletely. Keep your movements slow and steady

# Four. Status Tracking Category (Enhancing Self-Awareness
# 1. Daily "Physical Condition Score" (1-5 points)
- Scoring dimensions: Sleep quality (1= extremely poor, 5= excellent), energy level (1= tired, 5= energetic), degree of muscle soreness (1= no soreness, 5= severe soreness)
- Professional value: Through records, the correlation between "sleep - training - status" can be discovered (for example, if sleep is ≤3 points, the training performance the next day will decline), and the plan can be adjusted in a timely manner
- Tools: You can use a memo, a health APP, or a paper form to record before going to bed every day

# Professional Tips
1. Micro-habit execution principle: "Complete 1-2 every day", not pursuing quantity, prioritizing the persistence rate (a preliminary habit can be formed within 21 consecutive days)
2. Avoid excessive accumulation: Execute no more than 2 micro-habits at the same time. Add more after you get used to them
3. Risk-free Commitment: All movements have been verified for safety. People with no exercise background or chronic diseases (no contraindications) can perform them. If any discomfort occurs, stop immediately
