# 健康筛查问卷（PAR-Q）| Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
用途：基于「国际运动科学协会（ISSA）」标准PAR-Q问卷，用于训练前评估用户健康状况，识别潜在运动风险，判断是否需要医疗评估后再开始训练。核心逻辑：所有用户在开始任何训练计划前，必须完成该问卷。

# 一、PAR-Q核心问卷（必答）
# 请回答以下问题（近12个月内是否出现过以下情况）：
1. 医生是否告知你有心脏病、高血压、糖尿病、高血脂、骨质疏松等慢性疾病？
2. 运动时或运动后是否出现过胸痛、胸闷、头晕、呼吸困难等症状？
3. 是否有未愈合的骨折、关节损伤（如韧带撕裂）、肌肉拉伤等运动相关损伤？
4. 是否有哮喘、慢性支气管炎等呼吸系统疾病，运动时会加重症状？
5. 是否有癫痫、晕厥等病史，或曾在运动中突然晕倒？
6. 是否怀孕或产后不足3个月？
7. 医生是否建议你限制体力活动，或告知你不能进行高强度运动？
8. 是否有严重的腰背痛、颈肩痛，影响日常活动或运动？
9. 是否有甲状腺疾病、肾脏疾病、肝脏疾病等其他慢性疾病？
10. 是否正在服用可能影响运动的药物（如降压药、降糖药、激素类药物）？

# 二、问卷结果判断与处理流程
# 1. 低风险（所有问题均回答“否”）
- 处理：可直接开始低-中强度训练（如快走、新手力量训练），无需医疗评估
- 后续建议：训练中若出现不适（如头晕、关节疼痛），立即停止训练，重新评估

# 2. 中风险（1-2个问题回答“是”，且非严重疾病）
- 处理：
  - 若问题涉及“关节损伤、腰背痛、轻度高血压（血压＜140/90mmHg）”：可开始低强度训练（如慢走、徒手拉伸），避免高强度、高冲击运动
  - 若问题涉及“糖尿病、高血脂、甲状腺疾病”：需提供近3个月内的体检报告（血糖、血脂、甲状腺功能），根据报告调整训练计划
- 后续建议：每3个月重新评估一次，若症状加重，需就医检查

# 3. 高风险（≥3个问题回答“是”，或涉及严重疾病）
- 处理：立即暂停所有训练计划，必须先进行医疗评估（如心电图、关节X光、血压监测），获取医生开具的“运动许可证明”
- 禁忌运动：高冲击运动（如跑步、跳跃）、高强度力量训练（如大重量深蹲、硬拉）
- 后续建议：根据医生建议制定个性化训练计划，避免自行增加训练强度

# 三、补充评估项目（可选，提升筛查准确性）
# 1. 基本身体指标测量
- 身高、体重、BMI（BMI=体重kg/身高m²）：
  - BMI＜18.5（偏瘦）：需增加热量摄入，训练以增肌为主，避免过度消耗
  - BMI 18.5-23.9（正常）：可正常进行中低强度训练
  - BMI 24.0-27.9（超重）：训练以减脂为主，低-中强度有氧+轻重量力量训练
  - BMI≥28.0（肥胖）：优先低强度有氧（如慢走、游泳），避免高冲击运动（保护关节）
- 腰围：
  - 男性≥90cm、女性≥85cm：属于中心性肥胖，增加心血管疾病风险，训练需重点控制腰围

# 2. 生理指标测试
- 静息心率：正常范围60-100次/分钟，＞100次/分钟（心动过速）需就医检查，＜60次/分钟（运动员除外）需评估心脏功能
- 血压：正常范围收缩压90-139mmHg，舒张压60-89mmHg：
  - 收缩压140-159mmHg/舒张压90-99mmHg（1级高血压）：低强度训练，避免憋气、高强度运动
  - 收缩压≥160mmHg/舒张压≥100mmHg（2级及以上高血压）：暂停训练，先控制血压

# 3. 运动能力测试（低强度，无风险）
- 6分钟步行测试：在平地连续步行6分钟，记录步行距离：
  - ＞550m：运动能力良好，可进行中强度训练
  - 400-550m：运动能力中等，可进行低-中强度训练
  - ＜400m：运动能力较弱，需低强度训练，逐步提升

# 四、特殊人群额外筛查
# 1. 青少年（13-18岁）
- 补充问题：
  - 是否有生长痛、骨骺炎（如胫骨结节骨骺炎）等青春期常见损伤？
  - 是否有注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）等神经系统疾病？
- 处理：需家长签字同意，训练以低强度、趣味性为主，避免高强度力量训练（影响骨骼发育）

# 2. 老年人（≥60岁）
- 补充问题：
  - 是否有跌倒史（近6个月内）？
  - 是否有认知障碍（如老年痴呆）？
  - 关节活动度是否受限（如膝关节屈伸困难）？
- 处理：训练以平衡训练、低强度有氧为主，避免单独训练，需有人陪同

# 3. 孕妇（3个月以上）
- 补充问题：
  - 是否有流产史、早产史？
  - 孕期是否出现过阴道出血、腹痛等异常情况？
- 处理：仅允许低强度训练（如孕妇瑜伽、慢走），避免腹部受压、剧烈扭转动作，需产科医生评估

# 五、筛查频率与更新
- 首次训练前：必须完成完整问卷+基本指标测量
- 定期更新：每6个月重新评估一次，若期间健康状况变化（如确诊疾病、受伤），需立即重新筛查
- 训练强度提升前：如从低强度改为中高强度，需重新评估，确保身体能适应

# 六、常见误区纠正
# 1. 问卷填写误区
- 误区1：隐瞒健康状况（如高血压患者回答“否”）→ 导致训练中出现风险（如血压骤升）
- 误区2：认为“小毛病不影响”（如轻度膝关节炎）→ 若不调整训练计划，可能加重损伤

# 2. 筛查流程误区
- 误区1：仅填写问卷，不测量身体指标 → 无法全面评估（如BMI超重但问卷无相关问题）
- 误区2：筛查后不更新 → 健康状况变化后，原训练计划可能不再适用

# 专业提示
1. 问卷仅为初步筛查，不能替代医疗诊断：若筛查结果为中高风险，必须就医进行专业评估
2. 记录筛查结果：将问卷答案、身体指标测量结果存档，方便后续训练计划调整
3. 告知用户风险：筛查后需明确告知用户训练中的注意事项（如高血压患者避免憋气），签署训练风险告知书
# Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q
Purpose: Based on the standard PAR-Q questionnaire of the International Association of Sports Science (ISSA), it is used to assess the user's health status before training, identify potential sports risks, and determine whether a medical assessment is needed before starting training. Core logic: All users must complete this questionnaire before starting any training program.

# I. PAR-Q Core Questionnaire (Mandatory)
# Please answer the following question (Have the following situations occurred in the past 12 months) :
Did the doctor inform you that you have chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood lipid, osteoporosis, etc.?
Have you ever experienced symptoms such as chest pain, chest tightness, dizziness, or shortness of breath during or after exercising?
3. Are there any unhealed fractures, joint injuries (such as ligament tears), muscle strains or other sports-related injuries?
4. Do you have respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic bronchitis that may worsen your symptoms during exercise?
5. Do you have a history of epilepsy, syncope, or have you ever suddenly fainted during exercise?
6. Are you pregnant or have given birth within less than three months?
7. Has the doctor advised you to limit your physical activity or informed you that you cannot engage in high-intensity exercise?
8. Do you have severe lower back pain, neck or shoulder pain that affects your daily activities or sports?
9. Are there any other chronic diseases such as thyroid diseases, kidney diseases, liver diseases, etc.?
10. Are you currently taking any medications that may affect your exercise (such as antihypertensive drugs, hypoglycemic drugs, or hormone drugs)?

# II. Evaluation and Processing Procedure of Questionnaire Results
# 1. Low Risk (Answer "No" to all questions)
- Handling: You can directly start low to moderate intensity training (such as brisk walking, beginner strength training) without a medical assessment
Follow-up advice: If any discomfort occurs during training (such as dizziness or joint pain), stop the training immediately and reevaluate

# 2. Medium-risk (Answer "yes" to 1-2 questions, and not a serious disease)
- Handling:
If the problem involves "joint injury, low back pain, and mild hypertension (blood pressure < 140/90 MMHG)" : Low-intensity training (such as slow walking and bodyweight stretching) can be started, and high-intensity and high-impact exercises should be avoided
If the question involves "diabetes, hyperlipidemia, thyroid diseases" : A physical examination report (blood sugar, blood lipid, thyroid function) within the last 3 months must be provided, and the training plan will be adjusted based on the report
Follow-up advice: Reevaluate every three months. If symptoms worsen, seek medical attention for a check-up

# 3. High Risk (answer "yes" to ≥3 questions, or involve serious illness)
- Handling: Immediately suspend all training programs. A medical assessment (such as electrocardiogram, joint X-ray, blood pressure monitoring) must be conducted first, and a "Exercise Permit Certificate" issued by a doctor must be obtained.
- Prohibited sports: High-impact sports (such as running, jumping), high-intensity strength training (such as heavy squats, deadlifts)
Follow-up suggestions: Develop a personalized training plan based on the doctor's advice and avoid increasing the training intensity on your own

# III. Supplementary Assessment Items (Optional to Enhance Screening Accuracy)
# 1. Basic physical indicator measurement
- Height, weight, BMI (BMI= weight in kg/ height in m²) :
- BMI < 18.5 (underweight) : It is necessary to increase calorie intake. Training should focus on muscle building and avoid excessive consumption
- BMI 18.5-23.9 (normal) : Normal moderate to low-intensity training can be carried out
- BMI 24.0-27.9 (overweight) : Training mainly focuses on fat loss, with low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise and light weight strength training
- BMI≥28.0 (obese) : Prioritize low-intensity aerobic exercises (such as slow walking and swimming), and avoid high-impact exercises (to protect joints).
- Waist circumference:
Men ≥90cm and women ≥85cm: This indicates central obesity, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Training should focus on controlling waist circumference

# 2. Physiological Index testing
- Resting heart rate: The normal range is 60 to 100 beats per minute. If it exceeds 100 beats per minute (tachycardia), medical examination is required. If it is less than 60 beats per minute (except for athletes), cardiac function assessment is needed
- Blood pressure: The normal range of systolic blood pressure is 90-139 MMHG, and diastolic blood pressure is 60-89 MMHG.
- Systolic blood pressure: 140-159 MMHG/diastolic blood pressure: 90-99 MMHG (grade 1 hypertension) : Low-intensity training, avoid holding your breath and high-intensity exercise
- Systolic blood pressure ≥160mmHg/ diastolic blood pressure ≥100mmHg (grade 2 or above hypertension) : Suspend training and first control blood pressure

# 3. Physical Fitness Test (Low Intensity, No Risk)
6-minute walk test: Walk continuously on flat ground for 6 minutes and record the walking distance:
- > 550m: Good athletic ability, capable of conducting moderate-intensity training
-400-550m: Moderate athletic ability, suitable for low to moderate intensity training
- < 400m: The athletic ability is relatively weak. Low-intensity training is needed and it should be gradually improved

# 4. Additional Screening for Special Groups
# 1. Teenagers (aged 13-18)
- Supplementary questions:
Are there any common injuries during adolescence such as growing pains and epiphyseal inflammation (like tibial tuberous epiphyseal inflammation)?
Are there any neurological disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
- Handling: Parental signature approval is required. The training should mainly be low-intensity and fun, avoiding high-intensity strength training (which may affect bone development).

# 2. Elderly people (aged 60 and above)
- Supplementary questions:
Have you ever fallen within the last six months?
- Are there any cognitive impairments (such as Alzheimer's disease)?
Is the range of motion of the joint limited (such as difficulty in flexion and extension of the knee joint)?
- Handling: The training should mainly consist of balance training and low-intensity aerobic exercises. Individual training should be avoided and accompanied by someone

# 3. Pregnant women (over 3 months old)
- Supplementary questions:
Is there a history of miscarriage or premature birth?
Did you experience any abnormal conditions such as vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain during pregnancy?
- Management: Only low-intensity training (such as prenatal yoga, slow walking) is allowed. Avoid abdominal pressure and violent twisting movements. Assessment by an obstetrician is required

# V. Screening Frequency and Update
- Before the first training: A complete questionnaire and basic indicator measurement must be completed
- Regular updates: Re-evaluate every six months. If there are any changes in health status during this period (such as confirmed diseases or injuries), re-screening should be conducted immediately
Before increasing the training intensity: If changing from low intensity to medium-high intensity, a re-evaluation is needed to ensure that the body can adapt

# VI. Correction of Common Misunderstandings
# 1. Misunderstandings in Filling Out Questionnaires
Misconception 1: Concealing health conditions (such as a hypertensive patient answering "No") → leading to risks during training (such as a sudden increase in blood pressure)
Misconception 2: Believing that "minor ailments don't affect" (such as mild knee arthritis) → If the training plan is not adjusted, it may aggravate the injury

# 2. Misunderstandings in the Screening Process
Misconception 1: Only filling out questionnaires without measuring physical indicators → Unable to conduct a comprehensive assessment (such as having an overweight BMI but no relevant questions on the questionnaire)
Misconception 2: Not updating after screening → The original training plan may no longer be applicable after changes in health conditions

# Professional Tips
1. The questionnaire is only a preliminary screening and cannot replace medical diagnosis: If the screening result is medium or high-risk, medical attention must be sought for professional assessment
2. Record screening results: Archive the questionnaire answers and physical indicator measurement results to facilitate subsequent adjustments to the training plan
3. Inform users of risks: After screening, users must be clearly informed of the precautions during training (such as avoiding holding their breath for patients with hypertension), and sign the training risk notification form
