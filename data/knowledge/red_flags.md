# 红旗信号指南 | Red Flags Guidelines
用途：基于「世界卫生组织（WHO）急救手册」和「运动医学临床标准」，明确运动中/运动后需立即就医的紧急症状，帮助用户和教练快速识别危险信号，避免延误治疗（如心肌梗死、横纹肌溶解等严重情况）。

## 一、心血管系统红旗信号（最紧急，需立即就医）
### 症状表现
1. 运动中/后突发胸痛、胸闷（压榨感、紧缩感），持续≥15分钟不缓解，可能放射至左肩、后背、颈部
2. 突发呼吸困难、喘息，无法正常说话（如跑步时突然喘不上气）
3. 头晕、头痛、晕厥（短暂失去意识），或意识模糊、胡言乱语
4. 面色苍白、出冷汗、四肢冰冷（休克前兆）
5. 脉搏异常（过快＞140次/分钟、过慢＜50次/分钟，或脉搏不规律）
6. 血压骤升（收缩压≥180mmHg/舒张压≥110mmHg），伴随头痛、呕吐

### 处理流程
1. 立即停止所有活动，让用户平躺（若呼吸困难可半卧位），保持安静
2. 立即拨打急救电话（120），告知症状和位置
3. 若用户有心脏病史，且随身携带硝酸甘油，可让其舌下含服1片
4. 监测脉搏和呼吸，若呼吸停止，立即进行心肺复苏（CPR）
5. 等待救护车时，避免移动用户，保持温暖（盖衣物）

### 专业依据：心血管系统红旗信号可能提示心肌梗死、心律失常、高血压危象等致命疾病，延误治疗死亡率极高（来源：WHO心血管急救指南）

## 二、肌肉骨骼系统红旗信号（需24-72小时内就医）
### 症状表现
1. 训练中突发肌肉撕裂感、剧痛，无法活动（如深蹲时大腿前侧剧痛，无法站立）
2. 关节畸形（如膝盖扭伤后弯曲异常、肩膀脱位后无法抬臂）
3. 训练后出现明显肿胀、淤青，且持续加重（如训练后24小时肿胀范围扩大）
4. 骨骼突出、压痛剧烈（可能是骨折，如手腕支撑时剧痛，能摸到骨头凸起）
5. 关节活动时出现“卡住”“弹响”，且伴随剧痛（如膝盖弯曲时卡住，无法伸直）
6. 训练后肌肉僵硬、疼痛，且尿液呈深棕色（横纹肌溶解前兆）

### 处理流程
1. 立即停止相关训练，避免损伤部位受力（如腿部损伤，避免走路）
2. 急性损伤（48小时内）：冰敷（每次15-20分钟，每2-3小时一次）+ 加压包扎 + 抬高患肢
3. 记录症状：拍摄肿胀、畸形部位照片，记录疼痛性质、出现时间
4. 24小时内就医检查（如X光、核磁共振），明确损伤类型（骨折、韧带撕裂等）
5. 禁止自行按摩、热敷（急性损伤热敷会加重肿胀）

### 专业依据：肌肉骨骼系统红旗信号可能提示骨折、韧带撕裂、横纹肌溶解等严重损伤，延误治疗可能导致慢性疼痛、功能障碍（来源：运动医学损伤处理指南）

## 三、神经系统红旗信号（需48小时内就医）
### 症状表现
1. 训练后出现肢体麻木、无力（如训练后手臂麻木，无法抓握）
2. 头晕、头痛持续不缓解，或伴随恶心、呕吐（可能是脑震荡、颅内出血）
3. 视力模糊、复视（看东西重影）、耳鸣
4. 平衡失调（走路摇晃、无法站稳），或协调能力下降（如无法正常穿衣、吃饭）
5. 言语不清、口角歪斜（中风前兆）
6. 颈部疼痛，且伴随上肢麻木、无力（可能是颈椎损伤）

### 处理流程
1. 立即停止训练，让用户平躺或静坐，避免剧烈活动
2. 若怀疑颈椎损伤（如颈部疼痛+上肢麻木），避免移动颈部，用衣物、书本固定头部
3. 拨打急救电话（120），或尽快前往医院神经内科检查（如头颅CT、颈椎核磁共振）
4. 告知医生训练情况（如是否有撞击、过度负重）
5. 就医前避免服用止痛药（掩盖症状，影响诊断）

### 专业依据：神经系统红旗信号可能提示颈椎损伤、脑震荡、中风等严重疾病，延误治疗可能导致永久性神经损伤（来源：神经外科急救指南）

## 四、消化系统/代谢系统红旗信号（需72小时内就医）
### 症状表现
1. 训练后剧烈腹痛、呕吐（可能是急性肠胃炎、阑尾炎）
2. 训练后持续腹泻（＞3次/天），伴随脱水症状（口干、尿少、头晕）
3. 体重骤降（1周内下降＞5kg），且无刻意减脂
4. 训练后出现黄疸（皮肤、眼白发黄），可能是肝脏损伤
5. 持续饥饿、口渴、多尿（糖尿病症状），或血糖骤升/骤降（如低血糖导致头晕、心慌）

### 处理流程
1. 停止训练，休息并补充少量温水（避免一次性大量饮水）
2. 若呕吐、腹泻严重，口服补液盐（避免脱水）
3. 尽快前往医院消化内科或内分泌科检查（如血常规、血糖、肝功能）
4. 记录饮食情况（如训练前吃了什么），告知医生

## 五、红旗信号与普通不适的区分
| 症状类型       | 普通不适（无需就医）                          | 红旗信号（需就医）                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 疼痛           | 肌肉酸胀、钝痛，休息后缓解                    | 刺痛、撕裂痛、持续不缓解，或放射至其他部位      |
| 肿胀           | 轻微肿胀，24小时内缓解                        | 明显肿胀、淤青，持续加重，或伴随关节畸形        |
| 头晕           | 轻微头晕，休息5分钟后缓解                     | 剧烈头晕、晕厥、意识模糊                        |
| 呼吸           | 运动后轻微喘息，10分钟内恢复正常              | 突发呼吸困难、喘息，无法正常说话                |
| 尿液颜色       | 淡黄色、透明                                  | 深棕色、红色（横纹肌溶解、血尿）                |

## 六、预防与应急准备
### 1. 预防措施
- 训练前充分筛查：通过PAR-Q问卷识别潜在风险（如心脏病史）
- 避免过度训练：控制训练强度和时长，避免身体过度负荷
- 训练中关注身体信号：出现轻微不适（如轻微头晕）立即停止，不强行坚持

### 2. 应急准备
- 随身携带急救物品：创可贴、弹性绷带、冰敷袋、口服补液盐
- 保存急救电话：120（急救）、12320（公共卫生服务）
- 记录紧急联系人信息：训练时告知教练或同伴自己的健康状况和紧急联系人

## 专业提示
1. 红旗信号优先级：心血管系统信号＞神经系统信号＞肌肉骨骼系统信号＞其他系统信号，心血管信号需立即就医，不可延误
2. 不要自行判断：若无法区分是普通不适还是红旗信号，优先按红旗信号处理（就医检查）
3. 就医时提供信息：告知医生训练内容、症状出现时间、症状表现，帮助医生快速诊断

# Red Flags Guidelines
Purpose: Based on the "World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Manual" and "Clinical Standards of Sports Medicine", it clearly identifies emergency symptoms that require immediate medical attention during or after exercise, helping users and coaches quickly identify danger signals and avoid delaying treatment (such as myocardial infarction, rhabdomyolysis and other serious conditions).

1. Red Flag Signal of the Cardiovascular System (Most urgent, Immediate medical attention required)
Symptom manifestations
Sudden chest pain or tightness (a feeling of compression or constricting) during or after exercise, lasting for 15 minutes without relief, may radiate to the left shoulder, back or neck
2. Sudden breathing difficulties, wheezing, and inability to speak normally (such as sudden shortness of breath while running)
3. Dizziness, headache, fainting (brief loss of consciousness), or confusion and incoherent speech
4. Pale complexion, cold sweats and cold limbs (precursors of shock)
5. Abnormal pulse (too fast > 140 beats per minute, too slow < 50 beats per minute, or irregular pulse
6. Sudden increase in blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥180mmHg/ diastolic blood pressure ≥110mmHg), accompanied by headache and vomiting

Processing flow
Immediately stop all activities, have the user lie flat (or in a semi-reclining position if breathing is difficult), and keep quiet
2. Call the emergency number (120) immediately and inform them of your symptoms and location
3. If the user has a history of heart disease and carries nitroglycerin with them, they can take one tablet under their tongue
4. Monitor the pulse and breathing. If breathing stops, immediately perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
5. While waiting for the ambulance, avoid moving users and keep warm (cover with clothes).

Professional basis: Red flags in the cardiovascular system may indicate fatal diseases such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and hypertensive crisis. Delayed treatment can lead to extremely high mortality rates. (Source: WHO Cardiovascular Emergency Guidelines)

2. Red Flag Signal of the Musculoskeletal System (Seek medical attention within 24 to 72 hours)
Symptom manifestations
During training, there is a sudden feeling of muscle tearing and severe pain, making it impossible to move (such as severe pain in the front of the thigh when doing squats, making it impossible to stand).
2. Joint deformities (such as abnormal bending after knee sprain, inability to lift the arm after shoulder dislocation)
3. Obvious swelling and bruising occur after training and continue to worsen (such as the swelling area expanding within 24 hours after training)
4. Bone protrusion and severe tenderness (possibly a fracture, such as severe pain when the wrist is supported, and the bone protrusion can be felt)
5. When the joint moves, there is a feeling of "jamming" or "clicking", accompanied by severe pain (such as the knee getting stuck when bent and unable to straighten)
6. After training, the muscles become stiff and painful, and the urine appears dark brown (a precursor to rhabdomyolysis)

Processing flow
1. Immediately stop the relevant training and avoid applying force to the injured area (for example, if the leg is injured, avoid walking).
2. Acute injury (within 48 hours) : Ice application (15-20 minutes each time, every 2-3 hours) + compression bandaging + elevation of the affected limb
3. Record symptoms: Take photos of the swollen and deformed areas, and record the nature and occurrence time of the pain
4. Seek medical attention within 24 hours for examination (such as X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging) to determine the type of injury (fracture, ligament tear, etc.)
5. Do not massage or apply heat by yourself (heat application for acute injury will aggravate swelling).

Professional basis: Red flags in the musculoskeletal system may indicate serious injuries such as fractures, ligament tears, and rhabdomyolysis. Delayed treatment may lead to chronic pain and functional disorders. (Source: Guidelines for Injury Management in Sports Medicine)

Iii. Red Flag Signal of the Nervous System (Medical attention required within 48 hours)
Symptom manifestations
Numbness and weakness in the limbs occur after training (such as numbness in the arms after training and inability to grasp)
2. Persistent dizziness and headache that do not subside, or accompanied by nausea and vomiting (possibly concussion or intracranial hemorrhage)
3. Blurred vision, double vision (double vision when looking at things), tinnitus
4. Imbalance (unsteady gait, inability to stand steadily), or decreased coordination (such as inability to dress or eat normally)
5. Slurred speech and crooked mouth corners (precursors of stroke)
6. Neck pain, accompanied by numbness and weakness in the upper limbs (possibly cervical spine injury)

Processing flow
Stop the training immediately. Have the user lie flat or sit still and avoid strenuous activities
2. If cervical spine injury is suspected (such as neck pain + numbness in the upper limbs), avoid moving the neck and fix the head with clothes or books
3. Call the emergency number (120), or go to the neurology department of the hospital as soon as possible for examination (such as head CT, cervical magnetic resonance imaging).
4. Inform the doctor of the training situation (such as whether there was any impact or excessive weight-bearing)
5. Avoid taking painkillers before seeking medical treatment (as they may mask symptoms and affect diagnosis)

Professional basis: Red flag signals in the nervous system may indicate serious diseases such as cervical spine injuries, concussions, and strokes. Delayed treatment may lead to permanent nerve damage. (Source: Neurosurgery Emergency Guidelines)

4. Red Flag Signals in the digestive System/Metabolic System (Seek medical attention within 72 hours)
Symptom manifestations
Severe abdominal pain and vomiting after training (possibly acute gastroenteritis or appendicitis)
2. Persistent diarrhea after training (more than 3 times per day), accompanied by dehydration symptoms (dry mouth, reduced urine output, dizziness)
3. Sudden weight loss (more than 5 kilograms within one week), and no deliberate fat loss
4. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) after training may indicate liver damage
5. Persistent hunger, thirst, polyuria (symptoms of diabetes), or sudden spikes/drops in blood sugar (such as dizziness and palpitations caused by hypoglycemia)

Processing flow
Stop training, take a break and drink a small amount of warm water (avoid drinking a large amount of water at one time).
2. If vomiting and diarrhea are severe, take oral rehydration salts (to prevent dehydration).
3. Go to the hospital's gastroenterology department or endocrinology department as soon as possible for tests (such as blood routine, blood sugar, liver function).
4. Record your diet (such as what you ate before training) and inform the doctor

V. The Distinction between Red Flag Signals and Ordinary Discomfort
Symptom type: General Discomfort (No need for medical attention) Red Flag Signal (Requires medical attention
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
Pain: Muscle soreness, dull pain, which eases after rest; stabbing pain, tearing pain, persistent pain that does not ease, or radiating to other parts of the body
Swelling: Mild swelling, relieved within 24 hours; Significant swelling, bruising, continuous aggravation, or accompanied by joint deformity
Dizziness: Mild dizziness, relieved after 5 minutes of rest; Severe dizziness, fainting, and confusion
Breathing: Slight wheezing after exercise, returns to normal within 10 minutes. Sudden breathing difficulties, wheezing, and inability to speak normally
Urine color: light yellow, transparent, dark brown, red (rhabdomyolysis, hematuria)

Vi. Prevention and Emergency Preparedness
1. Preventive measures
- Adequate screening before training: Identify potential risks (such as history of heart disease) through the PAR-Q questionnaire
- Avoid overtraining: Control the intensity and duration of your training to prevent your body from being overburdened
- Pay attention to body signals during training: Stop immediately if you experience any mild discomfort (such as a slight dizziness), and do not force yourself to persist

2. Emergency Preparedness
Carry first aid items with you: band-aids, elastic bandages, ice packs, and oral rehydration salts
- Save emergency phone numbers: 120 (emergency), 12320 (public health services)
- Record emergency contact information: Inform your coach or partner of your health condition and emergency contact during training

Professional Tips
Red flag signal priority: Cardiovascular system signal > nervous system signal > musculoskeletal system signal > other system signal. Cardiovascular signals require immediate medical attention and should not be delayed
2. Do not make your own judgment: If you cannot distinguish whether it is a common discomfort or a red flag signal, prioritize handling according to the red flag signal (seek medical attention for examination).
3. Provide information when seeking medical treatment: Inform the doctor of the training content, the time when symptoms appeared, and the manifestations of symptoms to help the doctor make a quick diagnosis
